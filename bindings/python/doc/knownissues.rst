Known Issues
============

This is an alpha release meant for early users to try the bits and
provide feedback on the usability and functional aspects of the API.
**Also please expect the API to undergo changes over the coming
weeks, which may break backwards compatibility of programs written
against the alpha release**.

-  Only a subset of the planned functionality is available; features
   like distributed training, automatic LR and MB size search and API
   extensibility will become available over the next few weeks.

-  Python 2.7 support is currently unavailable but will be part of the
   upcoming beta release.

-  On Windows only Python 3.4 is supported and not Python 3.5 since the
   latter requires Visual Studio 2015 which CNTK has not yet migrated
   to. This will also be addressed before the upcoming beta release.
